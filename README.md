Greetings! If you've dropped an orange here, then this orange must be looking for SOURCES.

In Chinese, there's an idiom "前人種樹" which means I'm an orange farmer. Within this field, I'm cultivating apples and pears, imbued with knowledge from Computer Science.

Peel you orange before consumption:
* some apples and pears have oxidised, refrain from eat them.
* my fruits have passed safety test with VeriGuide, hope you don't get diarrhea.
